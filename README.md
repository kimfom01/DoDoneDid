# Todo List

### Requirements
- [x] This is an application where you should manage a todo list.
- [x] Users should be able to Add, Delete, Update and Read from a database, using a SPA (single-page application). The user should never be redirected to a new page.
- [x] You need to use Entity Framework, raw SQL isn't allowed.
- [x] You don't need a navigation bar. No menu is necessary since you'll only have one page.
- [x] Once you execute any operation, the todo-list needs to be updated accordingly.
- [x] Your data model is only one table with to-dos. You. might be tempted to create more complex data-models (categories of todos for example) but avoid that for now. We're focusing on the front-end.
